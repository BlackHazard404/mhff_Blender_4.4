These scripts are for manipulating various file types used in Monster Hunter
games for the Playstation Portable.

You can report issues, get the latest version, and view the source at:

All of these scripts require Python 3.x

The data.py script can be used to extract files from the main DATA.BIN file
that's on the UMD of any Monster Hunter game. For Monster Hunter 3rd and 2nd G
you must first decrypt the DATA.BIN file.

The package.py script can be used to extract files from package files.

The tmh.py script can be used to extract images from TMH files. Note that this
script is missing support for at least one TMH image format and has only been
tested on Monster Hunter Portable 3rd files.

The pmo.py script can be used to convert pmo models to Wavefront OBJ files.
Note that this script is still expirimental and has only been tested on some
Monster Hunter Portable 3rd models.
